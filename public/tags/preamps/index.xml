&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-music-setup:c368cc58dd1f380f08327a3c63238358&#34;&gt;My Music Setup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey internet, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to write a post looking at some upcoming
equipment I&amp;rsquo;ve purchased to finally get a decent sound for some of my
acoustic guitar recordings (Currently horrible quality through my phone,
so really anything else is an improvement). I&amp;rsquo;m writing this with a
budget of 6-7 hundred CAD for everything from pickups to audio interface
and software so here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve put together so far!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-typical-setup:c368cc58dd1f380f08327a3c63238358&#34;&gt;A Typical Setup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/EQpTen8.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Rig Overview&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing too fancy here, just an overview from guitar to PC for
recording. I&amp;rsquo;ll go through each of these segments individually in this
post to give you an idea as to what each does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;source:c368cc58dd1f380f08327a3c63238358&#34;&gt;Source&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, if you&amp;rsquo;re going to be recording something, you probably should
make some noise, so I&amp;rsquo;ve got one of these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/Owt3RBO.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Source&#34; /&gt;
Tanglewood Sundance Pro TW73&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, there are several types of pickups at your disposal; you may have
one already installed with a preamp, or you may need to install one
yourself. Based on the kind of things I&amp;rsquo;d like to play and listen to
(Andy cKee, Antoine Dufour, Mike Dawes, Pierre Bensusan, Michael
Hedges), namely percussive fingerstyle. In general you want to be able
to balance various aspects of your sound: You want to control how much
volume a hit to the body of the guitar (so you don&amp;rsquo;t sound like you&amp;rsquo;re
just smacking the crap out of it with a few quiet notes thrown in
between). So with this in mind, you will want to have multiple pickups
and therefore multiple channels running simultaneously. This is a lot
like recording a voice mic, and an instrument together, or in extreme
cases 8 mics for drum kits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;** Pickups and Mics **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to pickup percussive hits like palm or finger slaps on the body
of the guitar, you&amp;rsquo;ll want an internal condenser microphone installed
near the guitar&amp;rsquo;s soundhole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to pickup harmonics and reduced finger noise (focused on string
vibration only) you&amp;rsquo;ll probably want to get a magnetic pickup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to keep the sound natural and acoustic sounding while still
leveling off finger noise and pickup internal resonance you may want to
get a transducer pickup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting all of this together, you&amp;rsquo;re looking at 2 or 3 inputs out of one
guitar&amp;hellip; Looking at what some of my favourite artists use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;** Transducer / Condenser Mic Combo: ** K &amp;amp; K Trinity Pro system, used
by Andy McKee, Callum Graham&amp;hellip;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roughly $280 CAD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://kksound.com/products/images/trinity/kktrinitypromini.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;K &amp;amp; K Trinity Pro 
System&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;** Passive Magnetic Soundhole Pickup: ** DiMarzio Black Angel DP234,
used by Mike Dawes, Antoine Dufour, Jimmy Wahlsteen &amp;hellip;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roughly $240 CAD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.dimarzio.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/product_pickup/The-Black-Angel_DP234.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Dimarzio Black Angel 
DP234&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: This pickup requires a minimum diameter soundhole of 86mm (3.5&amp;rdquo;)
to be of any use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right, so now that you&amp;rsquo;ve got an idea of the pickups, we probably want
to run these through a preamp in order to balance each channels gain,
volume, and colour. This is not an absolute requirement, but it gives us
more control before we chuck it into the audio interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;preamps:c368cc58dd1f380f08327a3c63238358&#34;&gt;Preamps&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are soooo many options to go through here, and as I have not yet
had the chance to experiment too much with these, I&amp;rsquo;ll just leave it to
common sense by following what requirements: Unless you want to spend a
boatload of money, you probably want to get either two cheap mono
channel preamps, or a single multichannel if you can find them at a
reasonable cost. Here are some possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This thing is absolutely beautiful, however budget does not allow for
this sort of fancy, but hey The Headway EDB-2 has got to be one of the
best options on the market.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roughly $500 CAD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.headwaymusicaudio.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/EDB-2-5.3.13_0013R-640x471.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Headway 
EDB-2&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another option, also quite pricey, dual channel mixer and equalizer,
the K &amp;amp; K Quantum Blender:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roughly $470 CAD
&lt;img src=&#34;http://kksound.com/products/images/quantum/kkquantumblender-4.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;K &amp;amp; K Quantum 
Blender&#34; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;effects-eq-pedals:c368cc58dd1f380f08327a3c63238358&#34;&gt;Effects / EQ Pedals&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, now that you&amp;rsquo;ve got everything balanced, you may want to
flavour it up a bit with some effects, if you&amp;rsquo;ve got some old pedals
floating around, or a combination pedal, or a wah/volume control pedal,
nothing very fancy here, just an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;audio-interface:c368cc58dd1f380f08327a3c63238358&#34;&gt;Audio Interface&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is fundamentally the key component here, its taking all of your
fancy signals and throwing them at your PC to be recorded and then
processed and tweaked to your liking&amp;hellip; So, we&amp;rsquo;re looking at like 8
grand for this thing right? Nah, actually these are readily available at
decent costs, however it seems every channel that you add cranks the
price up significantly. Thankfully, if you were able to mix your sound
into 1 or 2 channels it is not too bad:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PreSonus AudioBox USB - Dual channel, Phantom power, headphones,
MIDI&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www-media-presonus.netdna-ssl.com/uploads/products/media/images/AudioBox_USB-02.png&#34; alt=&#34;PreSonus AudioBox 
USB&#34; /&gt;
  * Roughly $120 CAD&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;USB Dual Pre Project Series - Dual channel preamp

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roughly $100 CAD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well that&amp;rsquo;s all we have time for today folks, happy jamming!&lt;/p&gt;

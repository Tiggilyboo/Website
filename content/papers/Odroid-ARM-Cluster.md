## Original Course Paper (2014)

This paper was writted for an operating systems course (COIS-3320H) in 2014. It analyses the ARM big.LITTLE architecture and scheduling algorithms. The paper documents
the steps in order to create an Odroid beowolf cluster (Single board ARM computers) and set up messaging using MPICH3 and a central NFS storage.

## Original Course Papers (2014)
Here are a collection of papers I wrote for an advanced algorithms course (COIS-4050H) in 2014. Still remains to be the hardest course I've ever taken!

* [Selection / Median of Medians, Recursive Tiles, and Majority problems (PDF)](http://simonwillshire.com/files/AA_A2.pdf)
* [Euclidian Travelling Salesman problem (PDF)](http://simonwillshire.com/files/AA_ETSP.pdf)

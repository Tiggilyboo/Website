## Hello there!

If you haven't guessed by the site name, my name is Simon Willshire. I recently finished my undergraduate degree in Computer Sciences specializing in software
engineering. I've worked for a few small software companies; creating and designing new solutions,
converting large legacy applications, as well as maintaining existing ones. This site will hope to track my technological
discoveries and thoughts along the way. This site also keeps track of [papers](http://simonwillshire.com/papers) that I've written during my degree, as well as any research that I've
been doing in my spare time. Generally I'll be using this site as a landing page for potential job opportunites as well as to keep track of any projects that I've been working on - These
projects will usually lie within the technology genre. Besides the software content on the site, I also
post some music, and other hobbies...

## Influences & Sources

## Hello there!

If you haven't guessed by the site name, my name is Simon Willshire. I've worked for a few software companies; creating and designing new solutions, migrating large legacy applications, as well as maintaining existing ones. This site will hope to track my technological discoveries and thoughts along the way. I posted some of my undergrad [papers](http://simonwillshire.com/papers) that I've written during my degree, as well as any research that I've been doing in my spare time. Generally I'll be using this site as a landing page for potential job opportunities as well as to keep track of any projects that I've been working on - These projects usually lie within the technology genre. Besides the software content on the site, I also post some music, and other hobbies...
